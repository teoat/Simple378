## ⚠️ RISK MITIGATION

### Critical Risks & Mitigations

```
RISK: Database migration failure
IMPACT: Complete deployment failure
MITIGATION: Test all migrations on staging, create backup, prepare rollback

RISK: Load balancer misconfiguration
IMPACT: Traffic not reaching backend
MITIGATION: Test on staging, verify configuration, gradual traffic shifting

RISK: Frontend CDN deployment failure
IMPACT: No UI available
MITIGATION: Test build, CDN upload, cache invalidation procedures ready

RISK: Memory leak in backend
IMPACT: Performance degradation over time
MITIGATION: Monitor memory during deployment, prepare restart procedure

RISK: Database connection pool exhaustion

MITIGATION: Monitor connections, prepare pool resize, termination procedures

RESPONSE PLAN: Instant rollback procedure (< 5 minutes) documented for all
```

### Rollback Procedure

```
If critical issue occurs:
1. STOP deployment immediately
2. Assess severity (error rate, latency, downtime)
3. Decision: Continue monitoring or rollback
4. Execute rollback if needed (< 5 minutes)
5. Restore to previous version
6. Investigate root cause
